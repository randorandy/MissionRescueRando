WEB ROLLER
The most accessible way to use this randomizer is the web roller here:
https://randorandy.github.io/MissionRescueRando/
Be sure you are using the 2.5 version (no IBJ) found on the forum:
https://forum.metroidconstruction.com/index.php/topic,3601.0.html

LOCAL DOWNLOAD
If you prefer an offline or custom experience, you may want to use python3 and roll locally:
1.download this repository
2.place a copy of the Redesign rom in the roms folder - it must be named Lost World.sfc
3.run Main.py in console
This should create a randomized rom with the given name in the roms folder and a spoiler log (.txt) in the spoilers folder.

FAIR WARNING
This logic has been somewhat tested, but the game is too massive for me to get everything
working perfectly. If you find a logical issue, please contact me and I would love to
improve the logic file.

THANKS
Thanks to beauxq, and without the Subversion rando none of these other projects would have been possible for me:
